- Ranked matchmaking algorithm (relaxing elo as time passes without conditions for a game to start) -> FUCKING SCUFFED
- When client logs in, server sends him a unique token that can be used to relog without credentials (When user connects to server, check if there's an entry in token.txt that's valid and send it)
- If player.state == LOST_CONNECTION keep him in queue for 5 secs then remove him if he doesn't reconnect in time.
- Check if user is already logged in when there's an attempt to log in.
- Validate input in client (Auth menu, game mode menu, answers in game)
- Gain/lose more or less elo based on opponent elo
- Cancel game if players disconnect while waiting for game start (check if all players connected at the start of the game)
- User input for hostname and port (command args)
- When server stops, clients maybe crash or maybe continue running until communication attempt is made, handle exceptions and tell client server is offline.
- If Game is queued, tell users they have to wait
- Handle user disconnects mid-game, game keeps running, disconnected player get all remaining answers wrong and his elo is updated
- Comentar codigo
- Fechar sockets, selectors, etc

Think about:
- Lock connectedClients ??

When a user logs in, and he isn't yet logged in:
    - Generate a token and give it to him.

When user tries to log in with an already logged-in user:
    - Tell him he's already logged in and to try and login with a previously given token or wait MAX_LOSS_CONNECTION_TIME_SECONDS seconds until server purges him.
